    <h3 id="overview" style="color: green;">1.1 Overview</h3>
   <p><b> Hydrogen combustion engines</b> work similarly to traditional gasoline engines but burn hydrogen instead of petrol. 
    This process produces water vapor as the primary emission, making it much cleaner than fossil fuels. Kawasaki, 
    for example, is developing a hydrogen-powered motorcycle based on their Ninja H2 model. 
    This bike uses a supercharged engine modified for direct hydrogen fuel injection, 
    which helps maximize power output while <mark>minimizing emissions</mark></p>

    <h3 id="scope"> 1.2 Scope</h3>
    <p>The project scope inclue:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Technological Development</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Fuel Cell Integration:</b> Developing efficient and compact hydrogen fuel cells that can fit within the limited space of a motorcycle frame. This includes designing fuel cell stacks and integrating them with electric motors1.</li>
            <li><b>Hydrogen Storage:</b> Creating safe and efficient hydrogen storage solutions that can be easily refueled and provide sufficient range for practical use1.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Infrastructure and Refueling</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Refueling Stations:</b> Establishing a network of hydrogen refueling stations to support the widespread adoption of hydrogen motorcycles. This is crucial for the practical use of these vehicles1.</li>
            <li><b>Hydrogen Production:</b> Ensuring that hydrogen is produced in an environmentally friendly manner, such as through electrolysis using renewable energy sources1.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Research and Testing</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Prototype Development:</b> Building and testing prototypes to evaluate performance, safety, and efficiency. This includes both laboratory testing and real-world trials23.</li>
            <li><b>Open-Source Platforms:</b> Some projects, like those at MIT, are developing open-source platforms to allow other researchers and developers to test and improve hydrogen motorcycle technology2.</li>
        </ul>
